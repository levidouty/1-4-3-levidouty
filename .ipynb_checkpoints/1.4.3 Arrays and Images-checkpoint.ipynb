    "Even very routine computer work involves constant manipulation of images. Every time you move a window on the screen, click on a menu, or even just move the mouse, the pixels on the screen change. What algorithms are used to determine the zeros and ones for the graphics card to send to the monitor? \n",

    "In the previous activity, you created an ndarray called ax. It was an array of SubplotAxes objects. You accessed one SubplotAxes by using an index in square brackets: ax[0]. You probably recognize that this is the same syntax used to access an element of a list. However, the ndarray is different than a list; it is an array. All the elements of an array are of the same type, and as a result the computer can access the elements more quickly. Lists and tuples are slower than arrays, but they can mix different data types, like strings and integers. \n",
